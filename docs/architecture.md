# Architecture and Design

The Quantum Cryptography Distribution is a collection of hardware and software components that work together to provide quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptographic schemes. 

## Hardware Components

- Quantum Key Generator: a physical device that generates a stream of quantum-entangled photons that are used to establish a secure key between two communicating parties.
- Quantum Channel: a physical channel that carries the quantum-entangled photons from the quantum key generator to the quantum receiver.
- Quantum Receiver: a physical device that receives the quantum-entangled photons and uses them to establish a secure key with the quantum key generator.

## Software Components

- Error Correction: algorithms and techniques that are used to detect and correct errors that may occur during the key generation process.
- Privacy Amplification: algorithms and techniques that are used to extract a shorter, more secure key from the raw key generated by the quantum key generator.
- Key Distribution: a system for securely distributing the generated key to the intended recipients.
- Key Management: a system for managing the lifecycle of the keys, including key generation, distribution, and destruction.
- Network Integration: components that integrate the system into an existing network infrastructure.
- Post-quantum Cryptographic Schemes: various cryptographic schemes that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.

## Deployment

The Quantum Cryptography Distribution is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh. The hardware components are connected to the Kubernetes cluster via the network, and the software components are deployed as Kubernetes pods.

## GUI

The project also has a web-based user interface, built with ReactJS, to interact and configure the system.

## Security

The system has been designed with security in mind, and various security features have been built-in, such as:
- Regular security testing and vulnerability scanning
- Regular hardening and penetration testing

## Conclusion

The Quantum Cryptography Distribution is a highly secure system that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to establish a secure key between two communicating parties. It provides a simple, yet powerful interface for users to interact and configure the system, and its deployment on Kubernetes makes it easy to integrate into existing infrastructure.
