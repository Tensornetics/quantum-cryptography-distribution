# Security Guide

The Quantum Cryptography Distribution is designed to provide secure communication through the use of quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptographic schemes. However, as with any cryptographic system, it is important to understand the potential vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate them.

## Overview

This security guide covers the following topics:

- Threats and vulnerabilities 
- Security assessment
- Hardening and penetration testing
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Incident response and disaster recovery

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

Quantum Cryptography Distribution is vulnerable to various threats like:

- Eavesdropping 
- Tampering with the quantum channel
- Denial of service
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

To mitigate these threats, it's important to:
- Use authenticated channels for key distribution
- Use trusted hardware for key generation
- Regularly perform security assessments and penetration testing

## Security Assessment

Regular security assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that the system is configured in accordance with industry best practices.

## Hardening and Penetration Testing

- Use appropriate network segmentation and access controls
- Use secure protocols and cipher suites
- Keep all software and firmware up to date
- Use a firewall to block unwanted traffic

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

Quantum Cryptography Distribution is compliant with the following standards:

- NIST Special Publication 800-57
- Quantum-Safe Cryptographic Algorithm (QSCA)
- ISO/IEC 15408

## Incident Response and Disaster Recovery

- Establish incident response and disaster recovery plans
- Test incident response and disaster recovery procedures
- Have a Business continuity plan
- Keep a incident response and disaster recovery log
